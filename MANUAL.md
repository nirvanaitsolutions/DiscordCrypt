# Installation

**DiscordCrypt™** is installed just like any other
    [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases) plugin.
    If you do not have BetterDiscord installed, be sure to do that first before continuing with
    this guide.

**N.B** For now, the plugin has ***only*** been tested on *Windows* and *Linux* but it
    should work for all operating systems that support BetterDiscord.

For installation on specific operating systems, see below:



#### Windows

* [Download](https://gitlab.com/leogx9r/DiscordCrypt/raw/master/build/discordCrypt.plugin.js?inline=false)
    the plugin file.

## Verifying Signatures

For every release starting with version
    [`1.2.4`](https://gitlab.com/leogx9r/DiscordCrypt/tags/v1.2.4),
    we [sign](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x135.html) the plugin using
    [GPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard) for increased security.

***You should ALWAYS verify the signature of this plugin before installing it to ensure it has
    not been maliciously tampered with.***

For Windows and Linux operating systems, we recommend you use
    [`Kleopatra`](https://www.openpgp.org/software/kleopatra/) for verifying signatures and for
    MacOS, we recommend [`GnuPG for OS X`](https://gnupg.org/download/index.html).

The signature for each release is located [here](build/discordCrypt.plugin.js.asc).
    Please read the manual for your specific client to determine how to verify signatures.

If everything goes well, you'll notice output similar to below:

```
$ gpg --verify build/discordCrypt.plugin.js.asc
gpg: assuming signed data in `build/discordCrypt.plugin.js'
gpg: Signature made Fri 1 Jun 2018 00:00:01 AM 00 using RSA key ID 3787CE3F
gpg: Good signature from "DiscordCrypt (DiscordCrypt Signing Key)"
```

The above depends on the client you use but you must always look for a
    "*Good*", "*OK*" or "*Valid*" signature.

Please note, you will need to import the PGP signing key located [here](build/pgp_signing_key.asc)
    and **NOT** the binary Ed25519 signature `discordCrypt.plugin.sig.bin` to verify signatures.

Finally, you should manually verify that the signing key you imported above matches the
    information below:

```
Key ID: 3787CE3F
Key ID ( Long ): 0xB8EC0775960AEB2E4C11F084DA613E753787CE3F
Fingerprint: B8EC 0775 960A EB2E 4C11 F084 DA61 3E75 3787 CE3F

Key Server: hkp://keys.gnupg.net OR hkp://pgp.mit.edu
UID: DiscordCrypt (DiscordCrypt Signing Key)
Hash: 0xDA613E753787CE3F
```

**N.B.** The plugin self-verifies every update so you only ever need to verify the above PGP signatures once upon your first
    installation. Updates get verified using an [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) signature.

The public key for update signature validation is:

```
Hex: 44 6A 93 CE 8D 5D 69 D3 13 18 0E C5 4E EF 29 21 E2 1F 64 A4 DF 20 83 39 05 38 6F B6 FA 53 B7 42
Base64: RGqTzo1dadMTGA7FTu8pIeIfZKTfIIM5BThvtvpTt0I=
```


# Usage

**DiscordCrypt™** creates a menu bar upon loading, allowing you to interact with the plugin.

---

![Menu Bar](images/menu-bar.png)

---

These icons each offer a different functionality as follows:

* **[1] Upload Encrypted Clipboard**
    * This uploads your current clipboard to the Up1 file service and sends an encrypted link
        to the file to the current channel.
    * After uploading, this sets your clipboard to the deletion link for the uploaded file which
        you may use to either manually delete the file after your colleague has downloaded it
        or for later deletion. To use that deletion link:
        * Use the host `https://share.riseup.net/< deletion link >`
    * You are limited to a maximum of 50 MB.
* **[2] Upload Encrypted File**
    * This opens the file upload menu that you may use to encrypt and upload a file less than
        50 MB to an Up1 service.
    * You may choose whether to randomize the file name and whether to attach a deletion link
        to the message.
    * If sending the deletion link, it will not be in the URL format to avoid accidentally deleting
        the file. To use that deletion link:
        * Use the host `https://share.riseup.net/< deletion link >`
    * You are also able to write a message prior to sending the file which will be sent immediately.
        * Standard message limits apply. Messages longer than the maximum length will be split
            into multiple messages.
    * Files are encrypted using *AES-256* in [CCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCM_mode) mode
        as per Up1's protocol.
* **[3] Plugin Settings**
    * This menu controls the settings for the plugin.
    * You can enable and disable each option here.
    * This also contains a database management menu allowing you to import and export your current
        passwords.
        * Note that exported entries are **NOT ENCRYPTED** and as such should be handled
            with caution.
    * The ability to restore ignored updates or manually checking for updates may be done within
        the "**Security Settings**" sub-menu.
* **[4] Enable/Disable Message Encryption**
    * Clicking this button either enables or disables automatic encryption.
    * Automatic encryption will **always** encrypt any message sent
        **as long as passwords are defined** for the current channel.
    * Clicking this button changes the lock icon to an unlock icon indicating messages sent will
        not be automatically encrypted.
        * Clicking this icon again re-enables automatic encryption and changes the lock icon back
            to the default seen above.
    * This button is channel specific meaning that when you switch channels, it will use
        your last setting. By default, automatic message encryption is **disabled**.
* **[5] Password Settings**
    * This menu allows you to set, modify, reset or copy the passwords applied to the
        current channel being viewed.
    * If you reset the current passwords, they will use the default passwords defined in
        `Plugin Settings`.
    * Using the `Copy Current Passwords` button to the clipboard for sharing.
* **[6] Passphrase Generator**
    * This allows you to generate a unique passphrase for whatever reason.
    * We recommend you use this when you want to send passwords for a non-DM channel.
    * Passphrases contain roughly _13 bits_ of entropy per word.
    * You should use a passphrase that is at least **10 words** long.
    * Word lists are provided by the
        [EFF Diceware](https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt) list.
* **[7] Generate & Send New Public Key**
    * This can **ONLY** be used in DMs.
    * This button is used to start or generate a new encrypted session between two users.
    * Once you start a new session with a friend, you can re-generate it at any time.
    * This is further detailed below.



### Creating a new database

Every time Discord starts, you will be met with a prompt seen below:

---

![Greeting Prompt](images/greeting-prompt.png)

---

**DiscordCrypt™** uses an AES-256 encrypted database file in
    [GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) mode to store its information and
    uses a ***master password*** to unlock this file.

The first time you use the plugin, you'll be prompted to input a new password that will
    be used to create the database.

Every additional time you start or restart Discord, you'll be prompted with the above screen
    where you must enter the same password as before. If you don't enter the same password,
    you will not be able to unlock your database and decrypt any messages.

All exchanged keys and passwords are saved to this database and **cannot be recovered**
    if the master password is lost so be sure to use a strong but memorable one.
    ( [Forgot Password?](#frequently-asked-questions) )

Your password for this database **must meet at least one** of the below requirements.

- Your password MUST contain at least one uppercase & lowercase letter, a number and a symbol
    and be **at least** 8 characters in length.
    - Example: `p@s$w0rD` ( **PLEASE DO NOT USE SOMETHING THIS.** )
- Your password must be **GREATER THAN 32 characters** in length.
    - Example: `gestation broken directive coveting bony unrevised monogram clapped anchovy unmasking handiness actress`

**N.B. This password is the only thing protecting all others and as such, should be a very
    strong and unpredictable.**


### Changing the database password

If you wish to change your master password, you may do so in the `Plugin Settings` menu.
    ( ![settings-menu](images/settings-menu.png) )

You can only do this however, after you unlock the database with your previous password.

If you [forgot your password](#frequently-asked-questions) then you will need to reset the
    database.

If you enter a password in the `New Master Database Password` field and save your settings,
    this key will be used to encrypt the database in the future.

![master-password](images/master-password.png)

**N.B.** If a key is not entered into this field, it is ignored. Your current password will
    **NOT** be replaced.



### Exchanging Keys


While we give users a choice regarding the options they want to use when originally setting up
    an encrypted conversation via manually setting passwords, we offer a simple way to do it,
    while still enforcing strong cryptography methods.

This involves using an
[asymmetric key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)
    algorithm which, while allowing you to send information via an insecure channel, allows a
    strong secret key to be shared between two parties.


#### Personal Conversations

###### Private Messaging

To start a secure session with another person, they need to have this plugin installed.

After which, you can start a secure session with them using the following steps:

* Generate a key and send a new public key using the Auto-Key-Exchange button.
    ( ![s1](images/auto-handshake.png) )
* If your partner has the `Automatically Accept Key Exchanges` option switched on, they will
    immediately attempt to establish a session with you..
* If they do not have `Automatically Accept Key Exchanges` enabled, you will need to wait
    for them to manually accept the exchange.

![session-establishment](images/session-establishment.png)


![session-prompt](images/session-prompt.png)


###### Channels And Group DMs

Exchanging keys for a group conversations or channels is more complex and a generally longer
    process. You may want to leave your group chat unencrypted if you don't discuss anything
    sensitive.

* Generate **two** passphrases using the `Generate Secure Passphrase` option. These will
    be the keys that will be used to encrypt the channel.
* Open up your favorite text editor and take note of the passphrases you generated.
    Make sure you specify which passphrase will be used as the primary and secondary key.
* Establish a secure session with every member you want to read encrypted messages
    in the group chat. This step is **mandatory** to avoid compromising security.
* Send these keys to every member that needs them.
* Switch to the group chat and apply both the primary and secondary key using the
    `Password Settings` menu. This must also be done by every peer you sent these keys to.
* You *may* need to restart the Discord app ( `Ctrl+R` ) after doing this to read old messages.


###### Sharing Existing Passwords

You can sharing existing passwords with other users but it is **highly** ***unrecommended***.
    We recommend you simply generate new keys for the conversation and send these to the user
    and every other member. This prevents them from being able to read past messages.

* Switch to the group or channel that currently uses encrypted messages.
* Open the `Password Settings` menu. ( ![5](images/password-menu.png) )
* Click on `Copy Current Passwords` located at the bottom of the panel.
    * Please note this copies the keys from your current channel in an **UNENCRYPTED**
        form to your clipboard.
    * **KEEP THEM SAFE AND DO NOT SAVE THEM**.
* Paste your clipboard to your partner **only when you have established a secure session**.
    ( `Ctrl+V` or `Right Click -> Paste` )



### Resetting Or Updating Passwords

You may one day end up in a situation where you need to manually reset or update the
    password for the current conversation.

One such situation is when sharing keys for group conversations. ( See Above )

**N.B. We recommend against manually creating a password as we offer a tool to securely
    generate strong passwords for both parties.**

If it comes to this, you simply need to go to the `Password Settings` menu
    ( ![6](images/password-menu.png) ) to apply or reset your passwords for the channel
    you are currently in.

If you are manually updating the passwords to be able to have an encrypted group
    conversation, simply paste the "Primary Key" in the first field and the
    "Secondary Key" in the second field, then press `Save Passwords`.


## Configuring Settings

Settings can be configured within the *Plugin Settings* menu accessed via the toolbar.

These settings are classified by type:

* Plugin Settings
   - These are the general settings regarding how the plugin is to used.
   - You may configure which algorithms you want to use to encrypt messages or perform key exchanges but the 
        default options are generally considered the best.
   - The default password here is used to encrypt messages when you do not have a custom password set.
        - **N.B.** The default password here should *NEVER* be used to encrypt any confidential message as 
            this offers ***NO*** protection.
   - The message prefix can be used to indicate which messages were decrypted.
        - You may want to remove this prefix to have messages appear normally.
        - **N.B.** Removing this prefix makes it impossible to tell whether a message was encrypted or not!
   - This menu also allows you to configure timed messages. ( Or rather how long till a message is deleted. )
   - Finally, you can change your master database password here.
        - **N.B.** Make sure you click the `Save Settings` button after changing anything in this menu!

* Database Settings
    - This menu offers you the ability to view all passwords saved in the database as well as delete them 
        individually.
    - You may also use this to backup or restore your passwords saved.
        - **N.B.** *Passwords exported are **UNENCRYPTED** and should never be left on the disk longer than 
            necessary!*

* Security Settings
    - Allows you to view any blacklisted updates and information contained within them.
    - You may also remove any blacklists from this list to update to that specific version.
    - This menu also allows you to configure whether to automatically check for updates.
        - **N.B.** It is highly recommend you leave this turned on as plugin updates are verified and may 
            contain critical vulnerability fixes. Security advisories will be posted in the support server 
            whenever this occurs.
    - Finally, you may manually check for updates in this tab if you disabled automatic checking or if you 
        haven't yet received an update notification. ( By default, updates are checked for on an hourly interval. )

* About
    - Lists the plugin's license and various resource links for users.

# Best Practices

The following tips should be adhered to for maximum privacy between users.

* Change your master database password frequently.
* **NEVER** share passwords across unencrypted communications. Always establish a secure
    connection by means of a key exchange before sending passwords.
* Refresh your sessions on frequent basis. This ensures that even if your current
    session keys are compromised that an attacker will not be able to read any future messages.
* Use large key sizes ( preferably the maximum ) when exchanging keys. For Diffie-Hellman,
    this is 8192 bits or for Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, this is 521/571 bits. Prefer
    Post-Quantum exchange algorithms such as **Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman**.
* Use strong passwords for encrypting your database. Passwords **musst be at least
    8 characters long and contain a combination of alphanumeric ( ***A-Z***, ***0-9*** )
    and symbolic characters or be greater than 32 characters total**.
    * We recommend using a [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager)
        such as [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/)/[KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) or
        [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/) to generate and safely store strong passwords
        though we strongly prefer the KeePass app variants ourselves due to the fact that
        the database remains completely in the user's control and not in the cloud.
* Use AES as either the primary or secondary ciphers for encryption. AES is a cipher
    developed in 1998 and is still considered one of the most secure methods of
    sending and receiving confidential information to this day.
* If you require absolute secrecy which is not vulnerable to Discord's potential
    MiTM attacks, use the built in passphrase generator, encrypt these using PGP and
    send them to your partner over a non-Discord channel then manually apply these
    keys after you decrypt them.
* [Assess your risks](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/assessing-your-risks) and practice
    [operational security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security). Encryption is
    merely a tool which must be used properly to be effective.
* Look into alternative communication methods. If you don't need to use Discord, **don't**.
    Good alternative messaging apps include [Signal](https://signal.org/), [Wire](https://wire.com/),
    [Riot](https://about.riot.im/) and [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/) + [OTR](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/).
* Install the complimentary script [SecureDiscord](scripts/secureDiscord.js) for additional
    protection.
    * Configurable allowing you to choose which options to use.
    * Sets your user agent to [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)'s.
    * Sets additional HTTP headers to Tor defaults.
    * Blocks access to known Discord tracking URLs.
    * Blocks malicious and tracking based URLs using a block list.
    * Removes tracking from any external URL.
    * Removes several fingerprint based headers from requests.
    * Adds an additional [Do-Not-Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) header
        to all your requests.
    * Routes all your traffic through a SOCKS proxy running on your computer.
        - By default, this routes requests over Tor's default address. ( `127.0.0.1:9050` )



# Debugging

The official Discord client is built with the [Electron framework](https://electronjs.org)
    that uses a tweaked Chromium version bundled with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    support.

The DevTools console interface can be opened using the key combination of: `Ctrl + Shift + I`.

In the event that you encounter an error and wish to submit an issue to us to help
    resolve this problem, please follow these steps:

* First ensure you disabled all themes and plugins to
    [avoid possible incompatibilities](https://gitlab.com/leogx9r/DiscordCrypt/issues/5).
* Download and drop the `discordCrypt.plugin.js` into your BetterDiscord Plugins folder.
    Restart Discord afterwards. ( `Ctrl + R` )
* Exactly like on Chromium, you can open the debug console by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + I`.
* Watch your console while using the client as you would normally do. In the the opened
    debug console window switch to the 'Console' tab and see if there are any errors.

In case there is an error caused by the plugin, create an issue ticket with the
    exact debug output. You should, as a general practice of security, strip any
    identifiable information from your request. If however more information is
    required than you provided, we'll request it from you.

Be sure to read the [contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines before creating an issue.



# Frequently Asked Questions

### Isn't Discord already encrypted or private ?

Discord ***claims*** that all its messages are encrypted, and while that
    **is** true ***to an extent*** as they are sent over an HTTPS connection,
    it ***does NOT mean that they cannot see the content*** of your messages.

For anyone concerned about or valuing their right to privacy, this is an unfortunate
    caveat of using Discord.

Messages sent to your friends or servers are encrypted before they're sent out but
    are decrypted by Discord's servers.

This means anything you've ever sent, typed, or spoken could have been recorded and
    logged by Discord's owners.

Various messenger applications ( Signal, Riot etc. ) have taken user's privacy seriously
    and implemented [end-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption)
    so that no one, not even the platform's owners, can see what users do.

Discord has declined several suggestions to implement end-to-end encryption in the past and
    also constantly attempt to control what users can do or say by censoring users or group
    chats that they otherwise do not agree with.

We do not mean to say that hate-speech, racism or other morally wrong topics are okay
    but rather it violates free-speech when Discord themselves are given the right to choose
    what can and cannot be said by users.

In addition to this, Discord's current CEO, [Jason Citron](https://twitter.com/jasoncitron)
    previously founded another application quite similar to Discord,
    [OpenFeint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFeint) which had been caught harvesting and
    [illegally selling user data](https://courthousenews.com/gamers-say-openfeint-sold-them-out)
    to advertisers for profit which has since been shut down shortly after a class-action lawsuit
    was filed against them.

This also includes the fact
    that their system actively tracks users, their messages which they refuse to delete and
    generally, have been caught doing sneaky things in the past. See
    [here](https://tomsguide.com/us/help-me-toms-guide-discord-permissions,review-5104.html).

    The OpenFeint mobile gaming network collected data and personal information from its
    users’ cellphone-linked profiles and sold the information to Internet application developers,
    according to a federal class action.

    Lead plaintiff Matthew Hines claims Openfeint accessed, monitored and stored the unique
    device identifiers for mobile devices along with personally identifiable information such
    as a user’s exact GPS location, Internet browsing history and Facebook and Twitter profiles.

    OpenFeint’s business plan included accessing and disclosing personal information without
    authorization to mobile-device application developers, advertising networks and web-analytic
    vendors that market mobile applications, according to the complaint.

    The company acquired such information covertly, without adequate notice or consent,
    involving 100 million consumer mobile devices.

    After accessing one of OpenFeint’s applications, the company bypassed both the technical
    and code barriers designed to limit unauthorized access, as well as his mobile device’s
    privacy and security settings, Hines claims.

    OpenFeint used the data it collected to collaborate with application developers and create
    a database that further enabled the tracking scheme and conducted systematic and continuing
    surveillance of the class members’ mobile-device activity, which continues today.

    In spite of this activity, OpenFeint assures customers that its applications are all safe for
    downloading, according to the suit.

For visual proof of this, please see:

* [Initial E2E Request Denied](images/discord-end-to-end-denied.png)
* [Refusal For User Data Deletion](images/discord-refuses-to-delete-user-data.png)
* [Government Requests For User Data](images/discord-requests-for-user-data.png)

We highly disapprove of their ideals as we believe their actions violate every human's
    right to privacy.

This plugin attempts to implement the behavior of end-to-end encryption behavior so you
    can actually keep your messages between friends private.

While this plugin does not support, nor plan to support end-to-end voice encryption,
    messages and uploaded files via the encrypted file uploading interface **should**
    be safe and secure from prying eyes.



### Why does the plugin's source look so weird?

We recently added bigger libraries to the plugin ( Such as OpenPGP.js ), and as a result,
    we started compressing the plugin to save everyone a few megabytes of bandwidth every time
    **DiscordCrypt™** is downloaded.

Having such a large source would increase development complexity. If you wish to have a look at
    the uncompressed, original source, look at the source file:
    [src/discordCrypt.plugin.js](src/discordCrypt.plugin.js).



### Why's the UI so unattractive?

Unfortunately, the core project members have never been good CSS designers as we
    mainly specialize in internal application and system-level programming.

If you however do know how to make an attractive UI, please do create a pull request
    with your changes!


### How do I send nitro emojis?

To be able to send nitro-emojis, ( animated & emojis from any guild ) you need to join a
    nitro-only emoji server. After which, once you establish a secure session or group
    you will be able to select and use these emojis. You can optionally use the message
    encryption suffix to send the emoji automatically. Example: `:discordCrypt:|ENC`.

Autocomplete and the emoji picker works just as if you're a nitro user **only** if you've
    established a secure session first.



### Can I skip the password prompt?

The screen prompting you to unlock your database is necessary for **DiscordCrypt™** to
    function. Without it, you won't be able to send or receive any encrypted messages.

If you don't want to be bothered to unlock the database every time Discord starts up, you
    can disable the plugin in BetterDiscord's settings and enable it only when needed.


### Why does the plugin have to start on the friends or games tab ?


Due to the way Discord caches messages, any previously parsed message won't be able to be
    easily edited. This means if you view an encrypted channel before you unlock your database,
    you will not be able to see any previous messages prior to unlocking it. You will only be
    able to view messages you send or receive after this is done.

To avoid unnecessarily confusing users due to some messages not being decrypted,
    we've decided to force the client to reload on the Friends tab if the plugin loads when
    the client is viewing a channel or DM.



### What do I do if I forgot my Master Password?

You can reset your database ( and thus your configuration ) by deleting the file
    `DiscordCrypt.config.json` located in the same directory as the plugin that you went to
    during [installation](#installation).

**Doing this will reset your configuration** and allow you to enter a new password.
    Be aware that by resetting your configuration, **you will lose the passwords of all of
    your encrypted conversations** and as such, will be unable to read any previous messages.

As a result, you will need need to perform a new key exchange with your friends.
    If you're part of an encrypted group/channel conversation, you will need to generate
    new keys or ask someone to send you the passwords securely.



### How do I share passwords with new people?

While we do not recommend sharing passwords with newcomers, and instead suggest you generate
    new keys whenever that happens, you can copy the passwords of the current channel and
    share them by following [theses steps](#sharing-existing-passwords).



### Why is **DiscordCrypt™**'s CPU usage so high?

Unless you're generating keys or performing encrypted file uploads, **DiscordCrypt™** should not
    be resource-heavy.

Discord itself can be annoying in that regard as it generally uses a large amount of resources as
    all Electron applications [tend to](https://josephg.com/blog/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop/).


### Why is this so complicated?

Unfortunately, implementing privacy and message encryption in this manner is difficult to do.

We've tried to simplify the process as much as possible but once you get used to it, it becomes
    much easier.

# Known Limitations And Bugs

**DiscordCrypt™** is not ( and sadly cannot be ) perfect, the plugin is limited in the number
    of features it can provide.


* ***DiscordCrypt™'s key exchange is vulnerable to Discord's servers being used for
    [Man-in-The-Middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).***
    * While an attacker would need access to Discord's infrastructure as the data is
        encrypted in transit using TLS, it is in theory possible for an attacker,
        the government or Discord's administrators to sit in the middle of the
        key exchange.
        * We discussed this in greater details in the [TECHNICALITIES.md](TECHNICALITIES.md) file.

* Messages are limited to 1820 characters each.
    * Due to additional costs of encryption and verification, messages at maximum size will
        only be able to display 1820 characters of text..
        * If your message is longer than this, it will be split and sent in multiple messages.


* Voice channels cannot be secured, so what you verbally say in them could still be recorded by Discord.
    Only text messages and file uploads are end-to-end encrypted. However we still recommend using
        [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) to encrypt especially sensitive
        files before sending them.


* Searching past messages is impossible.
    * Since messages are encrypted and the search feature relies
        on the ability for Discord's servers to read past messages, the search functionality will
        always be unavailable.
    * If you require searching, you may send your messages in an unencrypted format by starting
        them with two hash characters  ( `##` ).
    * Messages also will be sent unencrypted if they begin with the forward-slash ( `/` ) character
        as these are also used for commands.



* Some third-party BetterDiscord plugins may conflict with **DiscordCrypt™**.
    * One such example discovered so far is the plugin `OldTitleBar` by DevilBro. This plugin
        causes **DiscordCrypt™**'s icons to be unclickable.
        * We do not plan to fix this, but feel free to contribute if you wish to do so yourself.
        * For a list of known problematic themes and plugins, see
            [here](https://gitlab.com/leogx9r/DiscordCrypt/issues/5).


* Messages cannot be encrypted when using the in-game overlay.
    * This is due to Discord using a separate module to display messages in the overlay that is
        unrelated to the Desktop app.
